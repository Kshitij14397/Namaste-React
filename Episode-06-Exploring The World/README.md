# Notes

- There are two types of imports and exports respectively.
- default exports and named exports.
- Named exports is used when you have to export multiple things from the same file.
- In one file, we can have only one default exports.

- Default Export/Import

export default Component
import Component from "path"

- Named Export/Import

export const Component
import {Component} from "path"


# React Hooks
- Normal JS functions
- useState(): Used to generate superpowerful state variables in react. They are superpowerful because React constantly keeps track on it. Whenever it updates, it triggers the React Fiber Algorithm.
- useEffect()

- The state variable keeps the UI sync with the data layer.
- Whenever the state variable updates, React re-renders the component.
- React is only good at DOM Manipulation (efficient)
- In React16, a new algorithm to update the DOM came out known as Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber) [Diff Algorithm and Updating the Actual DOM]
- Actual DOM is the html tags tree.
- Virtual DOM is the object representation of the Actual DOM.
- Virtual DOM is the Javascript object.
- Finding out the difference b/w two javascript objects is easier as compared to finding out the difference b/w two html codes.
- Whenever there is change in any state variable, React will find out the difference b/w Virtual DOMs(old and new), then it will re-render our component, i.e it will update the actual DOM.
- React has the Diff Algorithm to find out the difference b/w two Virtual DOMs.

# Episode 6: Exploring The World
- React has fast Render Cycle.
- useEffect(): If you have to do something after rendering the component, you write it in the useEffect's callback function argument.
- Error: Calling Swiggy's API from localhost is normally blocked by CORS policy. Our browser is not allowing us to call Swiggy's API from localhost(from one origin to another origin). If there is a origin mismatch, then browser blocks that API call. That is a CORS policy.
- Shimmer UI is like we load fake page UI until we get actual data from the API. This is much better user experience as compared to showing spinning loader.
- Whenever state variable changes, React will trigger the Reconciliation Cycle(re-renders the component in which that state variable is defined)
