# Notes
- JSX is a mix of HTML and JavaScript.
- JSX is not HTML inside JavaScript.
- JSX is not part of React.
- JSX is a HTML like syntax.
- JSX is not React element(object), it is a syntax.
- JSX is not pure JavaScript. Browsers/JS Engines does not understand JSX
- We can use core react to create react elements or JSX to create react elements.
- Browsers or JS Engines does not understand JSX, they only understand Javascript.
- So when we use parcel to build our app, JSX is transpiled or converted into core react which browsers/js engine understand.
- Parcel does not do this entirely on its own. It uses a library or package known as Babel.
- Babel is a Javascript Compiler or Transpiler.
- Some older browsers does not understand the newer versions of JavaScript code.
- Babel also convert those code into some codes which older browsers can understand.
- You can think of parcel as a manager and Babel as one of its employee.
- When you write attributes in JSX we follow camel case approach.
- When you write attributes in HTML we don't follow camel case approach.
- Component Composition: Component inside Component.
- You can use React Element inside React Element.
- You can use React Element inside React Component.
- You can use React Component inside React Element.
- You can use React Component inside React Component.
- Cross Site Scripting Attack is an Injection attack where some malicious code is inserted into your codebase which gets executed and harm the App.
- JSX prevents such type of attacks.
- What ever comes inside {} which is wrapped in JSX, it gets sanitized by the JSX and gets executed.
